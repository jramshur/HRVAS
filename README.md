## Description:

HRVAS is a complete and self-contained heart rate variability analysis software     (HRVAS) package. HRVAS offers several preprocessing options. HRVAS offers time-domeain, freq-domain, time-frequency, and nonlinear HRV analysis. All results can be exported to an Excel file. For processing many files HRVAS offers a bach processing feature. All settings/options can be saved to a .mat file and reloaded for future HRV analysis. Upon starting HRVAS all previously used settings/options are loaded.

HRVAS was orignally hosted at Sourceforge.com were it has been downloaded almost 10,000 times.  [http://sourceforge.net/projects/hrvas/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/hrvas/)
